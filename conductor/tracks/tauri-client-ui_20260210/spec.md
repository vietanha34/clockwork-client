# Specification: Tauri Client UI

**Track ID:** tauri-client-ui_20260210
**Type:** Feature
**Created:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Draft

## Summary

Build the React frontend inside the Tauri desktop app — a menu bar popover with active timer display (issue key, project, live elapsed time), daily worklog list, timer start/stop controls, and a settings screen for entering the user's Jira email.

## Context

Clockwork Menubar is a cross-platform menu bar / system tray app. The monorepo scaffolding and backend API routes are complete. The Tauri app currently has a minimal placeholder `<h1>Clockwork Menubar</h1>`. The window is configured at 380x560, no decorations, always on top, with a tray icon. This track builds the actual UI that communicates with the Vercel API backend.

## User Story

As a Jira user with Clockwork Pro, I want to see my active timer, daily worklogs, and control timers from a native desktop popover so that I don't have to switch to the browser.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Popover window opens when system tray icon is clicked
- [ ] Active timer section shows issue key, project, elapsed time (live-updating)
- [ ] Worklog section shows today's worklogs with time spent
- [ ] Stop button stops the active timer via API
- [ ] Start timer flow allows selecting an issue key and starting a new timer
- [ ] Settings screen for entering Jira email
- [ ] Graceful empty/error/loading states for all sections

## Dependencies

- `backend-api-timer-sync_20260210` (complete) — Vercel API routes (`/api/timers/active`, `/api/timers/start`, `/api/timers/stop`, `/api/worklogs`, `/api/issues/[key]`) and Inngest sync function

## Out of Scope

- Deployment / CI pipeline
- Auto-update mechanism
- Notifications / alerts
- Multi-account support
- Offline mode
- Windows/Linux platform-specific styling (macOS first)

## Technical Notes

- Use `@tanstack/react-query` for data fetching and caching
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Use Tauri v2 commands/events for Rust↔React IPC
- Polling interval for timer refresh (~5s)
- Popover is the existing Tauri window (380x560, no decorations, always on top)
- API types already defined in `apps/api/lib/types.ts` — mirror/reuse in client
