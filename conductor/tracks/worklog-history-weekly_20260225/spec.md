# Specification: Worklog History & Weekly Summary

**Track ID:** worklog-history-weekly_20260225
**Type:** Feature
**Created:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** Draft

## Summary

Upgrade the WorklogList area in MainView to support viewing worklogs for past days via a horizontal date strip and a weekly summary bar chart, with pill segment tabs to switch between list and chart views.

## Context

The Clockwork Menubar app currently shows only today's worklogs in a static list. Users need to review past days' worklogs and track their 8h/day target compliance across the week without opening Jira in a browser.

## User Story

As a Clockwork user, I want to review my worklogs from previous days and see a weekly overview chart so that I can track my 8h/day target compliance at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Pill segment control ("List" / "Summary") switches between daily worklog list and weekly chart
- [ ] Date strip shows Mon→Sun of current week with today highlighted; tapping a date selects it
- [ ] List tab shows worklogs for the selected date (reusing upgraded WorklogList)
- [ ] Summary tab shows custom SVG vertical bar chart with 7 bars (Mon→Sun) and 8h dashed target line
- [ ] Bars colored blue-500 (>=8h) or amber-500 (<8h); future days gray-200
- [ ] Hours displayed above each bar; weekly total displayed below chart
- [ ] No external chart library — pure inline SVG in React

## Dependencies

- Existing `useWorklogs(date)` hook (already accepts date param)
- Existing `useUnloggedDays` hook as pattern reference for `useQueries` multi-date fetching
- TanStack Query v5 (already installed)

## Out of Scope

- Multi-week navigation (only current week Mon→Sun)
- Calendar popup / date picker modal
- Stacked or breakdown charts (per-issue colors)
- Chart animations or transitions
- Weekend highlighting or special treatment

## Technical Notes

- Window is fixed 302x443px — all UI must fit within this constraint
- Date strip: 7 chips (~38px each) fit naturally in 302px without scrolling
- Chart SVG: scale bar heights relative to max(logged hours, 8h) for consistent rendering
- Reuse `formatSeconds()` from `api-client.ts` for time display
