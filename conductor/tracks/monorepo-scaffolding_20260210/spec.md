# Specification: Monorepo Scaffolding

**Track ID:** monorepo-scaffolding_20260210
**Type:** Feature
**Created:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Draft

## Summary

Initialize the Turborepo monorepo with all 3 apps (Tauri desktop client, Vercel API, Inngest background functions), shared configuration packages, pnpm workspace, git init, and base configs.

## Context

Clockwork Menubar is a cross-platform menu bar / system tray app for Clockwork Pro timer management. The architecture requires a monorepo with Turborepo containing 3 apps: `tauri` (Rust/React desktop client), `api` (Vercel serverless API routes), and `inngest` (background functions for timer data sync). This is the foundational track that establishes the project structure.

## User Story

As a developer, I want a fully structured monorepo with all 3 apps scaffolded so that I can start building features immediately without setup friction.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Turborepo monorepo with pnpm workspaces initialized
- [ ] Tauri v2 app scaffolded with React + Vite in `apps/tauri`
- [ ] Vercel API app scaffolded in `apps/api` with basic route structure
- [ ] Inngest app scaffolded in `apps/inngest` with Inngest SDK
- [ ] Shared TypeScript config and ESLint config packages
- [ ] All apps build and dev servers start successfully
- [ ] Git initialized with .gitignore

## Dependencies

- Requires pnpm, Rust toolchain, and Node.js pre-installed on the dev machine

## Out of Scope

- No actual feature logic (API routes, Inngest functions, UI components)
- No environment variables setup
- No deployment config
- No CI/CD pipelines
- Only project structure and build tooling

## Technical Notes

- Use official scaffolding tools: `pnpm create tauri-app` for Tauri, manual Vercel API setup, and Inngest init
- Turborepo for monorepo orchestration with pnpm workspaces
- Tauri v2 with React + Vite frontend
- TypeScript 5.x across all apps
