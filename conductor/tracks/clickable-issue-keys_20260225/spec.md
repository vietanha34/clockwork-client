# Specification: Clickable Issue Keys

**Track ID:** clickable-issue-keys_20260225
**Type:** Feature
**Created:** 2026-02-25
**Status:** Draft

## Summary

Make JIRA issue keys clickable in ActiveTimer and WorklogList components to open the issue in the user's default browser.

## Context

The Clockwork Menubar displays issue keys in two places: the active timer section and the worklog list. Currently these are plain text — users must manually copy the key and navigate to Jira. Adding clickable links reduces context-switching friction, which is a core product goal.

## User Story

As a Clockwork user, I want to click on an issue key so that I can quickly navigate to the Jira issue in my browser without manually searching.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Clicking issue key in ActiveTimer opens `{JIRA_BASE_URL}/browse/{issueKey}` in default browser
- [ ] Clicking issue key in WorklogList opens the same URL pattern
- [ ] Issue keys show hover state (underline + pointer cursor) indicating clickability
- [ ] Existing layout and styling unchanged
- [ ] Works on macOS and Windows via `@tauri-apps/plugin-shell`

## Dependencies

- `@tauri-apps/plugin-shell` (already installed)

## Out of Scope

- Configurable Jira URL from settings UI
- Making other elements clickable (project name, issue summary)

## Technical Notes

- URL constructed from hardcoded `JIRA_BASE_URL` constant + `/browse/{issueKey}`
- Uses `open()` from `@tauri-apps/plugin-shell` to launch default browser
- Design doc: [docs/plans/2026-02-25-clickable-issue-keys-design.md](../../../docs/plans/2026-02-25-clickable-issue-keys-design.md)
